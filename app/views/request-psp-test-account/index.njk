              If you’re planning to use Stripe, GOV.UK Pay’s Payment Service Provider, get a Stripe test account to test your end-to-end reporting process. The Stripe reports are different to those in a regular 'sandbox' account. You’ll be able to access new reports showing:
            </p>
            <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
                      <li>PSP fees, and gross and net payments</li>
                      <li>payments into your bank account</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="govuk-body">
              You can download the data as a CSV file or by integrating with our reporting and reconciliation API.
            </p>
            <p class="govuk-body">
              We can usually set up a Stripe test account for your service within 1 working day. We'll email you when it's ready and include information about making demo payments and accessing reports.
            </p>
            <p class="govuk-body">
              You'll find the Stripe test account in Overview under the service name. You'll have both a Pay test account ("sandbox") and Stripe test account.
